Diary of a Low Res Student is an immersive online multiplayer diary crafted using three.js, socket.io, MongoDB, Blender, Illustrator, and a touch of personal emotion. V1 was completed in just two weeks as my final project for the fall term at NYU, this endeavor was a synthesis of my learnings from the “Connections Lab” and “Critical Experiences” courses. The former emphasized creating full-stack web applications as artistic expressions, while the latter focused on research-based art practices.

Inspired by the interplay of these subjects, I aimed to design a virtual space where visitors could explore the memories and experiences of my journey through the IMA Low Res program. Upon entering, visitors are prompted to share their names and choose whether they feel strong, kind, or creative that day. Each participant appears as a Kami character in coveralls, with the color of their attire reflecting their chosen feeling. These details are also displayed on the “who’s online?” board, and the color of any flowers they plant in the diary corresponds to their selected emotion. The persistence of these flowers is achieved through a database that stores their coordinates and colors.

One of the most exciting challenges I faced was ensuring that each player’s character appeared and moved correctly on all other players’ screens. Initially, I attempted to display a static character model for each online player, but this approach was limited. I needed the models to update their positions and animations in real-time. To solve this, I stored data objects in an array that continuously tracked and updated each player’s position and actions. This allowed the animation player to accurately reflect movements based on the players' key inputs.

This project was a rewarding experience that allowed me to blend technical skills with creative storytelling. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in “Immersive Web” with a focus on shaders, aiming to push the boundaries of my capabilities even further.
